### Setup for use with motioneye here

This is a system for several camera to stream to a server to record, detect motion, etc. versus the standalone esp32 recorder

You also have to put your ESP32-CAM into programming mode (ground GPIO0 then power it on), and you must NOT have the Arduino Serial Monitor attached to the COM port.
    
After you have programmed the ESP32-CAM, you should get the config.txt file from here, open it with a text editor, and type in your ssid name and password, and then put that file onto an SD card and put it in the ESP32-CAM.  Then when you boot the ESP32-CAM it will connect to your network, and you can click its ip to do streaming, take a series of still pictures, download the movies you have recorded to your browser/computer, and edit the config.txt file to different framesizes, timelapses etc.

Click Connect to connect to ESP32-CAM and view console or send the firmware -- make sure Arduino serial monitor is closed!

Here is a link to the **config.txt** file you should save onto your sd card with your ssid and password.  The link below has comments to describe the fields in greater detail, or cut-and-paste this little window for the basics.
