New version installed Jan 12, 2022 - see "junior" above for details.  It uses a different config.txt file than the previous version, but it will create a new config.tx file, and you can edit in your ssid and password, and then make extra edit through the esp32 file manager while it is running.

You must have the Arduino IDE with the ESP32 boards library installed (giving you the ESP tools).
    
You also have to put your ESP32-CAM into programming mode (ground GPIO0 then power it on), and you must NOT have the Arduino Serial Monitor attached to the COM port.
    
After you have programmed the ESP32-CAM, you should get the config.txt file from here, open it with a text editor, and type in your ssid name and password, and then put that file onto an SD card and put it in the ESP32-CAM.  Then when you boot the ESP32-CAM it will connect to your network, and you can click its ip to do streaming, take a series of still pictures, download the movies you have recorded to your browser/computer, and edit the config.txt file to different framesizes, timelapses etc.
